# sellmanagement — Automated sell-preparation CLI

A small, safe command-line tool that watches your Interactive Brokers (IB) positions and prepares full-close sell orders when a position closes below an assigned moving average. The default mode is dry-run: orders are prepared and logged but never sent.

Why use this tool
-----------------
- Automates a single conservative rule: when a position's latest close is strictly below its assigned moving average at the top of the hour, the tool prepares a full-close sell order for that position.
- Keeps a clear audit trail in `logs/signals.jsonl` so you can review every prepared action.

Important behavior (read first)
--------------------------------
- **Positions and open orders are refreshed every minute and printed to your terminal.**
- **Signals are only generated at the exact top of each hour.** The app monitors continuously but evaluates sell rules only at that boundary.for end of day signals, the app uses 3:59:55. 
- **Signal Conditions:** the signal is only generated if the price is above  breakeven AND the assigned MA is also above break even
- **New Positions:* when new positions are added, restart the app so that the historical data is downloaded
- **Current behavior:** when a sell condition is met the app prepares a full-close of the entire position. Partial sells are NOT supported in this version.

Prerequisites
-------------
- Python 3.10 or newer. Download: `https://www.python.org/downloads/`
- Interactive Brokers Gateway or Trader Workstation (TWS) installed and running locally. Download page (IB Gateway & TWS): `https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=16040`
- Recommended: use an IB Paper Trading account when testing.

Quick start (copy-paste)
------------------------
Open a terminal (Windows PowerShell, macOS Terminal, Linux shell) and run these commands.

1) Clone the repository (or download and extract the zip):

```bash
# with git installed
git clone https://example.com/your-repo/sell_manager_CLI.git
cd sell_manager_CLI
```

2) Create and activate a Python virtual environment, then install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows PowerShell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not present, install the core packages manually:

```bash
pip install ib_insync pandas numpy pyarrow pytest
```


3) Run the app in dry-run (safe) mode

```bash
python -m sellmanagement --dry-run
```

What this does:
- Connects to IB on `127.0.0.1:4001` by default.
- Fetches positions and open orders.
- Downloads recent market data and computes configured MAs.
- Updates the positions table every minute and evaluates signals at the top of each hour.
- Appends signal audit records to `logs/signals.jsonl`.

4) Edit assigned-MA CSV (example)

The tool uses the file `assigned_ma.csv` to record which moving average to apply to each ticker. After the first run, you can manually edit `config/assigned_ma.csv` with this example contents:

```csv
ticker,type,length,timeframe
NASDAQ:AAPL,SMA,50,1H
NYSE:IBM,EMA,200,1H
NASDAQ:MSFT,SMA,20,1H
```

Field notes:
- `ticker` should be `EXCHANGE:TICKER`, e.g. `NASDAQ:AAPL`.
- `type` is `SMA` or `EMA` (case-insensitive).
- `length` must be one of: `5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 150, 200`.
- `timeframe` for this release should be `1H` (hourly evaluation) or `1D` (daily evaluation)

Switching to live mode (WARNING — sends real orders)
---------------------------------------------------
Live mode transmits orders to your IB account. Use only after careful testing in a Paper Trading account.

```bash
python -m sellmanagement --live
```

Configuration & files
---------------------
- `config/assigned_ma.csv` — mapping of tickers to MAs (example above).
- `logs/signals.jsonl` — append-only audit log for all prepared signals and actions.
- `config/cache/` — internal cache of downloaded market data.

Interpreting CLI output
----------------------
On start and after each update you will see a compact table per ticker showing:
- `ticker`, `latest close`, `assigned MA`, `MA value`, `percent distance`, `position size`, `open orders`, and `abv_be` (a safety flag used internally).

At the top of each hour, when a sell condition is met, a signal is printed and written to `logs/signals.jsonl` containing timestamp, ticker, close, ma_type, ma_value, distance_pct, and action details.

Common troubleshooting
----------------------
- IB connection refused: confirm IB Gateway or TWS is running and logged in. Common IB API ports are `4001` (IB Gateway SSL), `7496` (TWS non-SSL), and `7497` (TWS paper-trading). The app defaults to `127.0.0.1:4001` unless configured otherwise.
- Missing Python packages: run `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip install ib_insync pandas`.
- Permission errors writing logs: run the app in a folder where you have write permissions.

Contributing & tests
--------------------
- Tests use `pytest`. To run tests from the project root:

```bash
pytest -q
```

Please run tests locally and validate order flows in a Paper Trading account before using `--live`.

Support
-------
If you need help, open an issue or contact the repository owner. Include `logs/signals.jsonl` and your `config/assigned_ma.csv` when requesting help.

Changelog & status
------------------
This release implements the CLI, data download, MA computation, and signal logging. Remaining work in the project roadmap includes improved live-mode safety (global caps, idempotency tokens) and an adaptive rate-limiter for IB pacing.
